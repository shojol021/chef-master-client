                        <h4>What are the differences between uncontrolled and controlled components?</h4>
                        <p>Uncontrolled components are those where the form data is handled by the DOM itself, while controlled components are those where the form data is handled by the React component. In uncontrolled components, we use refs to get form values, while in controlled components, we set and update state with form values.</p>

                        <h4>How do you validate React props?</h4>
                        <p>One way to validate React props is to use PropTypes, which is a built-in feature of React. PropTypes lets us define the types and shapes of the props that a component expects to receive. This helps catch errors early and makes our code more robust.</p>

                        <h4>What is the difference between Node.js and Express.js?</h4>
                        <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of the browser, while Express.js is a web application framework that allows us to build web applications on top of Node.js. Express.js provides us with a set of tools and features to create web applications more easily, such as routing, middleware, and templates.</p>

                        <h4>What is a custom hook, and why would you create one?</h4>
                        <p>A custom hook is a function in React that you can create to help you reuse code. Instead of having to write the same code over and over again in multiple parts of your app, you can create a custom hook to do the job for you. Custom hooks are useful for encapsulating reusable logic, making your code more modular and easier to maintain. They can be created using built-in React hooks and can be shared across different components. Think of custom hooks like a recipe that you create once and use over and over again to make your favorite meal.</p>
